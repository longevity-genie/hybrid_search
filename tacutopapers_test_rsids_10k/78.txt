. Overall, our findings show that the ife-2 RNAi treatment and the double intervention odr-3(n1605); ife-2(RNAi) have a beneficial effect on motility-assessed healthspan, significantly increasing the period of full motility (SupplementaryFigure 5C; p < 2.0E-16) and exhibiting a decrease in the decrepit period of life. Similar data for the odr-3(n1605); ife-2(ok306) double mutant can be seen in SupplementaryFigure 5D, 5E and for the daf-16(mu86); odr-3(n1605); ife-2(ok306) triple mutant in SupplementaryFigure 5F.

Left panels show GFP images and right panels show Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) images captured with a confocal microscope. The arrow points to the nuclear accumulation of DAF-16::GFP in intestinal cells of odr-3 mutant. Images were obtained using the same confocal settings and exposure adjustments were uniformly applied in all images for better visualization.

AGINGSupplementary Figure 4 . 4Network schematic representation of the strains analyzed in this study and of the effects of each genetic intervention. Nodes represent the strains as follows: diamond for WT, circle for single gene interventions, square for double gene interventions, hexagon for triple gene interventions, and octagon for quadruple gene interventions. Nodes are positioned on the vertical axis according to their respective mean healthspan. Edges between worm strains are colored depending on the gain (or loss) in lifespan extension: increase (green), decrease (red) and small or non-significant change (gray). The extent of the change is included on the edge as a percentage increase/decrease between the origin and destination nodes of the edge. odr-3 and daf-16 denote mutants containing the odr-3(n1605) and daf-16(mu86) mutations; ife-2 and cku-70 denote animals in which these genes were modulated by RNAi bacteria.

Several sensory neurons are responsible for chemotaxis to volatile attractants found in food, pheromones or noxious odors [27,35,36], the nutrient perception by olfactory neurons being partially mediated by the DAF-2 pathway [36]. ODR-3, a G alpha protein with similarities to the members of Gi/Go protein family, is expressed in the sensory cilia of olfactory neurons, providing the main stimulatory signals for AWA and AWC sensory neurons [37,38]. Ablation of AWA and AWC sensory neurons, as well as loss-of-function mutations in odr-3, extend lifespan through a pathway that depends partially or completely on signaling via DAF-16 [27,36,39]. Food restriction can promote an adaptive metabolic response such as mobilization of fat stores through activation of AWC neurons [40], and decreased DAF-2 signaling is known to affect cellular metabolism by promoting the accumulation of lipids in the intestine and hypodermis [30]. All these suggest a link between food sensing, metabolic adaptation and longevity. On the other hand, the daf-2(e1370); odr-3(n1605) double mutant shows a greater lifespan extension than either of the single mutants and even than their cumulative effects, thus odr-3 and daf-2 could also function through complementary pathways [39].

While the relationship between ROS and longevity is still not completely understood and ROS can have both beneficial or detrimental effects on lifespan, most of the genetic manipulations that decrease ROS lead to an increased lifespan [41]. Like its mammalian orthologue, eIF4E, the C. elegans IFE-2 plays an important role in protein synthesis and its inactivation protects against oxidative stress and extends lifespan [42]. Since ife-2 impairment was found to extend the lifespan of longlived mutants such as daf-2, clk-1, eat-2 and let-363, it was suggested that down-regulation of protein synthesis induced by ife-2 deficiency might represent a distinct mechanism by which lifespan is regulated [21,42]. However, ife-2 inactivation might extend lifespan not only by decreasing the rate of protein synthesis, but also by regulating mitochondrial and peroxisomal metabolism, which in turn, could stabilize the homeostasis of reactive oxygen species and increase cellular accumulation of trehalose [43].

Lastly, CKU-70 is the C. elegans orthologue of KU70, which in mammals participates with KU80 to the DNA repair of double-strand breaks [44]. Downregulation of CKU-70 activity was found to increase sensitivity to genotoxic stress and thermotolerance, thus indicating a conserved role in both DNA repair and stress response [45,46]. Although RNA interference (RNAi) of cku-70 increases the lifespan of wild type (WT) animals only in an RNAi sensitized background, the fact that cku-70 knock-down extends the lifespan of daf-2 mutants as well [46] suggests that cku-70 might have an important role in aging.

Since odr-3, ife-2 and cku-70 deficiencies all potentiate the lifespan-extending effects of daf-2 mutants, it is also interesting to find if their mechanisms involve downstream pathways that converge toward common effectors. In this work, we analyzed the effect of combined interventions in odr-3, ife-2 and cku-70, on lifespan and healthspan, starting with L4 age. Since our lifespan and healthspan assays were carried out for all the combinations of the above-mentioned interventions, the use of synergism in the remainder of the paper refers to the "full synergism" definition. Our results show that simultaneous suppression of odr-3 and ife-2 functions additively extends lifespan and synergistically improves healthspan in a daf-16 dependent manner. Knock-down of cku-70 did not confer further benefits to lifespan or motility of odr-3; ife-2 mutants.

RESULTS

RNA interference of ife-2 but not cku-70 increases lifespan of the long-lived odr-3 mutants

To find new potential genetic interactions that could extend lifespan, we assessed the effect of a simultaneous depletion of ODR-3, IFE-2 and CKU-70. For this, we used the odr-3(n1605) putative null allele [37] and we knocked-down ife-2 and cku-70 by RNAi. The odr-3(n1605) animals exhibited at 20° C an increased mean (26.2%) and maximum (13.8%) lifespan compared with WT control animals. A significant mean lifespan extension was previously reported for odr-3(n1605) at 25° C, however the increase was very modest at 20° C [39]. Silencing of ife-2 by RNAi showed an 18.0% and 20.7% extension for the mean and maximum lifespan of WT, respectively ( Figure 1A and Supplementary Table 1), which are in agreement with previously reported data for both ife-2(ok306) mutants and ife-2 downregulated animals [21,42]. In our experiments, the RNAi knockdown of cku-70 in the WT worms produced only a marginal 4.4% increase for mean lifespan and was even slightly detrimental to maximum lifespan reducing it by 6.9% ( Figure 1B and Supplementary  Table 1), which is in agreement with previously reported data [46].

The odr-3(n1605); ife-2(RNAi) mutants exhibited more than 11% and 18% increase in mean lifespan compared with the odr-3(n1605) and ife-2(RNAi) single gene interventions, respectively (Table 1). Similarly, the maximum lifespan was also increased by more than 18% and 11% (Supplementary Table 1). Overall, compared with the WT controls, the combined odr-3 and ife-2 interventions extended mean and maximum lifespan by 40.3% and 34.5%, respectively ( Figure 1A and Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1). This effect demonstrates an almost additive impact on mean lifespan, i.e. 40.3% increase compared to 44.2%, the sum of the two individual effects (Table 1). Similarly, the lifespan extension for odr-3; ife-2; EV (46.1%), i.e. worms exposed to a 1:1 mixture of HT115 (Empty Vector -EV) bacteria and of ife-2 RNAi clone, was greater than the sum of individual effects (26.2% + 11.2%), supporting the existence of additive/synergistic mechanisms (Table 1).

Next, we assessed the effect of cku-70 silencing in both odr-3(n1605) mutant animals and ife-2 knock-down animals. We observed that cku-70 knock-down dramatically decreased the extension of mean lifespan conferred by the odr-3(n1605) mutation, from 26.2% to only 13.6% increase comparative with WT ( Figure 1B and Supplementary Table 1). The simultaneous knock-down of ife-2; cku-70 by RNAi was performed by co-feeding worms with a mixture of the two RNAi bacterial clones. As such, for an appropriate comparison, the survival curves of double knock-down worms (which are presumably exposed to about half dsRNA for each gene) have been compared with those of single knock-down worms exposed to the same concentration of dsRNA for each of the corresponding genes (concentrations obtained by co-feeding the worms with the target RNAi clone and the control RNAi(EV) in a 1:1 ratio). In general, we obtained very small differences between the lifespan of worms fed only with the RNAi clone and worms fed with the mixture of RNAi clone / RNAi(EV) (Supplementary Figure 1A-1C), with the only notable difference being for odr-3; cku-70 for which the mix (and hence lower concentration of cku-70 RNAi bacteria) did not show a pronounced lifespan reduction (Supplementary Figure 1D).

In our assays, the lifespan of the double knock-down worms ife-2; cku-70 was 15% longer than that of WT animals (p = 3.0E-16), with a small increase compared to each of the single knock-down worms (3.5% and 8.22% longer lived than the ife-2; EV and the cku-70; EV animals, respectively) ( Figure 1C and Supplementary Table 1). It should however be noted that these changes are very modest and that a slightly larger lifespan increase was obtained when worms were exposed to ife-2 RNAi alone, without EV mixing (18% compared to WT). Moreover, cku-70 knock-down had a negative effect on the lifespan of odr-3(n1605) mutants treated with ife-2 RNAi, decreasing the mean lifespan extension from 46.1% to 35.4% ( Figure 1D and Supplementary Table 1).

The extended longevity of odr-3; ife-2 double intervention might be independent of DAF-16

The FOXO family transcription factor DAF-16 is a transducer of many pro-longevity signaling pathways [47], thus it was natural to inquire to what extent the longevity of odr-3; ife-2 double inactivated animals require DAF-16. To answer this, we used the null daf-16(mu86) allele [32,48] that affects coding of all DAF-16 isoforms, to generate daf-16(mu86); odr-3(n1605) double mutants, and carried out RNAi silencing assays for ife-2 and cku-70 in this strain.

We observed that the lifespan extension induced by the odr-3(n1605) mutation was not only suppressed by the daf-16(mu86) mutation, but also that the lifespan of the daf-16(mu86); odr-3(n1605) double mutants were even shorter than the lifespan of the daf-16 mutants alone ( Figure 1E; mean and maximum lifespan decreased by 14.6% and 9.1% compared to daf-16; mean and maximum lifespan decreased by 26.3% and 16.7% compared with WT). A slight decrease of daf-16(mu86) lifespan induced by the odr-3(n1605) mutation was also previously reported [39].

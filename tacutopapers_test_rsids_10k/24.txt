Data analysis Evolutionary conservation

The analysis was performed using a software package developed in our lab, which automatically extracts and analyses data from the InParanoid database (http://inparanoid.sbc.su.se/cgi-bin/index.cgi [13]). For each gene, the presence or absence of orthologs across 205 proteomes (all species available excluding parasites) was defined and the evolutionary conservation was expressed as percentage of orthologs. The evaluation was performed for an inparalog score of 1.0. All comparisons were statistically significant unless otherwise mentioned (Chisquared Ï‡ 2 test; p < 0.05).

Enrichment analysis

Enrichment analysis of WHAGs was performed using the EnrichR toolset () [40]. As the data on human genes and proteins is the most complete among the tested species, the human orthologs of WHAGs defined in model organisms were used for the analysis. Statistical significance of enrichment was evaluated with the Fisher's exact t-test and the EnrichR combined score.

Longevity

associated genes (LAGs)

Longevity-associated genes were extracted from The Human Ageing Genomic Resources (HAGR) -GenAge Database of Ageing-Related Genes, build 17 [24].

Protein

protein interaction network

Protein-protein interaction (PPI) data from the BioGRID database ( [41], http://thebiogrid.org), human interactome, release 3.4.129, was used for the analysis of connectivity and interconnectivity. The entire human interactome was used as control. Network construction and analysis was performed using Cytoscape ( [42], http://www.cytoscape.org), version 3.3.0. Prediction of important network interactors was performed using the hypergeometric distribution test for relative connectivity [18].

Figure 1 : 1Evolutionary conservation of skin wound healing-associated genes. Each dot represents the percentage of orthologs between humans and a given species (in descending order by % of orthology). A total of 205 species from all kingdoms of life are presented (for a full list of species and conservation data see Suppl.

Figure 3 : 3Protein-protein interaction network of skin wound healing genes. Depicted in the figure is the largest continuous component of the wound healing network with the most enriched signaling pathways (See Figure 2). Included are also 27 WHAGs connected to the WH network only through the enriched pathways. Genes (N = 231) are depicted with green circles and KEGG pathways (N = 9) with yellow rectangles. The enriched pathways include a total of 114 WHAGs, with several genes belonging to multiple pathways. Depicted are 188 Gene-pathways connections and 566 gene-gene interactions.

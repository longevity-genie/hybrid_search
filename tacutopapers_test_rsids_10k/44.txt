Using systems biology tools, we found that CS is closely interconnected with aging, longevity and ARDs, either by sharing common genes and regulators or by protein-protein interactions and eventually by common signaling pathways. The most enriched pathways across CS, ARDs and aging-associated conditions (oxidative stress and chronic inflammation) are growth-promoting pathways and the pathways responsible for cell-extracellular matrix interactions and stress response. Of note, the patterns of evolutionary conservation of CS and cancer genes showed a high degree of similarity, suggesting the co-evolution of these two phenomena. Moreover, cancer genes and microRNAs seem to stand at the crossroad between CS and ARDs.

Our analysis also provides the basis for new predictions: the genes common to both cancer and other ARD(s) are highly likely candidates to be involved in CS and vice versa. Altogether, this study shows that there are multiple links between CS, aging, longevity and ARDs, suggesting a common molecular basis for all these conditions. Modulating CS may represent a potential prolongevity and anti-ARDs therapeutic strategy.

INTRODUCTION

Since Hayflick's discovery of the phenomenon of cellular (replicative) senescence [1], the contribution or even relevance of this phenomenon to organismal aging has been a subject for continuous debates [2][3][4][5]. Although the question still remains open, an increasing amount of evidence, especially from recent years, indicates that cellular senescence (CS) could have a role in aging and age-related diseases (ARDs), rather than being just a laboratory phenomenon [3,[6][7][8][9][10][11]. In fact, the current situation in the field could be defined as an attempt to understand to what extent and how is CS involved in aging and ARDs.

Apart from an irreversible growth arrest ("Hayflick's limit" -a finite number of cell divisions), the CS phenotype is characterized by cell hypertrophy, an increased metabolic activity including synthesis of Research Paper macromolecules (RNA, protein, lipid) and organelles [12,13], increased secretion of pro-inflammatory substances and resistance to apoptosis [7,8,11]. After being initially discovered in primary cultures of human fibroblasts, CS has also been found in other cell types such as keratinocytes, endothelial cells, lymphocytes, adrenocortical cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, chondrocytes, etc., both for in vitro and in vivo conditions [3,11,14,15], and in cell cultures derived from many other organisms examined thus far (e.g., mice, monkeys, chickens, Galapagos tortoise, etc.) [16][17][18]. Moreover, it appears that CS is not restricted only to dividing cells. At least some features of CS were also found in classical post-mitotic cells such as neurons, myocardiocytes and adipocytes (reviewed by Tchkonia et al. [19]). focus on the interplay between their components [11,12,20,21]. Here we consider the potential molecular links between CS, longevity, ARDs, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation from a systems biology perspective. Highlighting the common genes, interactions, regulatory molecules (miRNAs) and common pathways may help in understanding how CS interplays with and contributes to other aging-associated conditions.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

CS genes share common features with LAGs and ARD genes

A comprehensive data mining of scientific literature brought about a list of 262 human genes identified as being associated with CS (see Suppl. Table 1). These genes possess diverse functions, with the majority falling into three categories: regulation of cell cycle and proliferation, biosynthesis and programmed cell death (for GO functional analysis, see Suppl. Table 2). We have previously shown that longevity-associated (LAGs) and ARD genes also show functional diversity. Besides that, they display a number of distinct features including higher connectivity and interconnectivity, evolutionary conservation, and essentiality to growth and development [22][23][24]. This combination makes many of them putative candidates as antagonistic pleiotropy genes, i.e., genes which may have undesirable effects later in life, potentially linking aging, longevity and ARDs [25,26]. Therefore, one of the first questions that arise in this context is whether CS genes share any common features with LAGs and ARD genes.

Connectivity and interconnectivity: miRNAregulated PPI networks

To what extent are the CS genes/proteins working in a cooperative manner? In most cases, proteins do not act on their own but rather together with their partners through protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Currently, the human interactome includes approximately 10,000 genes with more than 35,000 physical PPIs ( [27], http://thebiogrid.org). Most of CS genes (231 of the 262) as well as LAGs and ARD genes can be found in the human interactome [24]. As shown in Fig. 1 (insert), they have a much higher average connectivity (number of first-order protein partners) compared to all interactome proteins. This is in accordance with observations demonstrating that disease proteins have higher average connectivity than other proteins, and that highly connected proteins are more likely to be diseaseassociated [28]. It was particularly evident for cancer genes [22] and for genes common to major human ARDs [23,25]. simulations with sets of randomly selected proteins are presented as dots. For all the sets of interest, the fraction of interconnected proteins was significantly higher than expected by chance (p < E-25). Insert: average connectivity (number of first-order protein partners) of the sets analyzed in this study. For more details, see Materials and Methods. www.impactaging.com Not only are CS genes, LAGs, and ARD genes more connected, but they are also highly interconnected.

Indeed, when compared with randomly generated sets, the above genes display a significantly higher interconnectivity (the fraction of genes that form a continuous network) (Fig. 1).

For example, 59% of the CS genes are connected between themselves and eventually form a continuous network (Fig. 2), whereas only 4 ± 2% (mean ± SD) genes form a network by chance (p < E−25). The percent of interconnected CS genes would be even higher if other (regulatory) interactions are considered. In particular, if we also take into account posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression by microRNAs (miRNAs), almost two thirds (64%) of the CS genes become connected, either through PPIs or common miRNAs (Fig. 2). Thus, CS genes together with their regulatory miRNAs might work in a cooperative manner by forming a miRNA-regulated PPI network. Such networks are also formed by LAGs and ARD genes (currently available in the NetAge database: [24], http://www.netage-project.org). www.impactaging.com

Essentiality

Genes with multiple PPIs have a higher probability to be essential, just because the deletions of these genes may result in the disruption of function of a larger number of proteins [28][29][30]. In line with this assumption, the portion of essential genes among the CS genes, LAGs and ARD genes is much higher than that in the whole genome or interactome (Fig. 3). Moreover, there is a significant correlation between connectivity and essentiality of different sets examined in this study (Fig. 3, insert). It is important to stress that many genes essential for development and growth tend to have detrimental effects at the later stages of life as suggested by the theory of antagonistic pleiotropy [31].

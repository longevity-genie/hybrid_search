We categorized genes according to three types of senescence: replicative, oncogene-induced or stress-induced. Replicative senescence was the default category, while genes were listed as oncogene-induced if the reference explicitly mentioned the gene induced or delayed oncogene-induced senescence. Finally, stress-induced senescence was used to indicate that the gene was necessary to induce or inhibit senescence caused by external stressors like drugs/chemicals, serum deprivation, or radiation. We also recorded whether a gene induces or inhibits CS. For example, a gene whose overexpression is associated with increased senescence is classified with the "induces" tag, whereas if the overexpression of a gene inhibits senescence, then it is classified with the "inhibits" tag. Similarly, if the knockout or knockdown of a gene induces senescence, then it is recorded with the "inhibits" tag. Together with the annotations identified in Additional file 1: Table S46, we also incorporated a number of secondary annotations into the database such as various gene identifiers, the gene description, gene interaction(s), and quick links to each senescence gene. The CellAge database also provides crosslinks to genes in other HAGR resources, i.e., GenAge, GenDR and Longevity-Map, which we hope will enable inferences to be made regarding the link between human aging and CS.

CellAge data sources

Build 1 of CellAge resulted in a total of 279 curated cell senescence genes which we have incorporated into the HAGR suite of aging resources. The HAGR platform comprises a suite of aging databases and analysis scripts. The CellAge interface has been designed with the help of JavaScript libraries to enable more efficient retrieval and combinatorial searches of genes. As with the other HAGR databases, we have used PHP to serve the data via an Apache web server. The raw data can be downloaded via the main HAGR downloads page in CSV format or filtered and downloaded from the main search page.

The first part of our work consisted in finding which genes driving CS are also associated with ARDs or with longevity, using the following data sources:

Human genes associated with CS: CellAge build 1. Human genes associated with human aging: GenAge human build 19. Human orthologues of model organisms' genes associated with longevity: proOrthologuesPub.tsv and antiOrthologuesPub.tsv file (https://github.com/ maglab/genage-analysis/blob/master/Dataset_4_ aging_genes.zip) [34]. Human oncogenes: Oncogene database (http:// ongene.bioinfo-minzhao.org/index.html). Human tumor suppressor gene database: TSGene 2.0 (https://bioinfo.uth.edu/TSGene/index.html). Human genes associated with ARDs (https://github. com/maglab/genage-analysis/blob/master/ Dataset_5_disease_genes.zip) [34]. This data concerns the 21 diseases with the highest number of gene associations, plus asthma, a non-aging-related respiratory system disease used as a control. Human genes differentially expressed with age from the GTEx project (v7, January 2015 release) [32,43].

CellAge data analysis

Statistical significance was determined by comparing the p-value of overlapping CellAge gene symbols with the different data sources, computed via a hypergeometric distribution and Fisher's exact test. We used PubMed to understand the relative research focus across the protein-coding genome and incorporate this into the analysis to account for publication bias. We used Bio-Mart to obtain approximately 19,310 protein-coding genes, then using an R script we queried NCBI for the publication results based on the gene symbol using the following query [89,90]:

("GENE_SYMBOL"[Title/Abstract] AND Homo [ORGN]) NOT Review [PTYP] The GENE_SYMBOL was replaced in the above query by each of the genes in turn. Certain genes were removed as they matched common words and, therefore, skewed the results: SET, SHE, PIP, KIT, CAMP, NODAL, GC, SDS, CA2, COPE, TH, CS, TG, ACE, CAD, REST, HR, and MET. The result was a dataframe in R comprising variables for the "gene" and the "hits." We used the R package called "rentrez" to query PubMed for the result count [91].

Evolution of CellAge genes

The percentage of CellAge genes with orthologues in Rhesus macaque, Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster were found using Biomart version 88 by filtering for genes with "one2one" homology and an orthology confidence score of one [89]. We also found the total number of human genes with orthologues in the above species using Biomart. Significance was assessed using a two-tailed z-test with BH correction.

The phylogenetic arrangement included twenty-four species representative of major mammalian groups. The genomes were downloaded in CDS FASTA format from Ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org/) and NCBI (https:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) (Additional file 1: Table S6).

To remove low quality sequences we used the clustering algorithm of CD-HITest version 4.6 [92] with a sequence identity threshold of 90% and an alignment coverage control of 80%. The longest transcript per gene was kept using TransDecoder.LongOrfs and TransDecoder. Predict (https://transdecoder.github.io) with default criteria [93]. In order to identify the orthologs of the 279 CellAge human genes in the other 23 mammalian species, the orthology identification analysis was done using OMA standalone software v. 2.3.1 [41]. This analysis makes strict pairwise sequence comparisons "all-againstall," minimizing the error in orthology assignment. The orthologous pairs (homologous genes related by speciation events) are clustered into OrthoGroups (OG) [94]; this was done at the Centre for Genomic Research computing cluster (Linux-based) at the University of Liverpool. The time calibrated tree was obtained from TimeTree (http://www.timetree.org/) and the images were downloaded from PhyloPic (http://phylopic.org/).

In order to structure the evolutionary distance for the CellAge genes between the five long-lived mammals and the others 19 mammalian species, the amino acid sequences from the 271 CellAge OrthoGroups were aligned using the L-INS-i algorithm from MAFFT v.7 [95]. Ambiguous and missing sites were removed from the alignments using the pxclsq function from phyx [96]. We concatenated the amino acid alignments using the concat function from AMAS [97] for the 271 CellAge genes. To analyze the variation of the CellAge genes in mammals, we obtained the branch lengths using loglikelihood for a fixed tree through IQ-TREE [98] for (a) the concatenated alignment (271 CellAge genes) and (b) the 22 CellAge genes conserved among the 24 mammalian species in order to understand the individual gene evolution. The topology of reference was the phylogenetic tree from TimeTree.

We used the Faith's phylogenetic diversity index (PD) [99] through the "picante" R package [100] to calculate the evolutionary distances. The Faith's PD index was used to calculate the sum of the total phylogenetic branch length for one or multiples species. We calculated the observed Faith's PD from our data and we compared the results with the expected Faith's PD (expected.pd) using a binomial sampling with a fixed probability of each tip being sampled.

Overlap analysis

We conducted overlap analysis using R to understand how the CellAge genes and signatures of CS were differentially expressed with GenAge, ARD, and cancer genes. We also examined the overlap between CS genes and differentially expressed signatures of aging [42], and genes differentially expressed in various human tissues with age. Fisher's exact test was used on the contingency tables and significance was assessed by p values adjusted via Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction. For the comparison of genes differentially expressed in at least one tissue with age between the CS genes and the genome, some genes were differentially expressed in opposite directions across numerous tissues (Additional file 2: Fig. S5A). Genes differentially expressed in both directions were added to the overexpressed and underexpressed DEGs in each CS gene list, and to the total number of genes in the genome to compensate for the duplicate gene count (Additional file 1: Table S14 and S15). Fisher's exact test was also used to test for significance of tissue-specific CellAge gene expression. Significance of overlap analysis between CellAge and LAGs was computed using a hypergeometric distribution and FDR was corrected using Bonferroni correction. The GeneOverlap package in R was used to test for overlaps between the CellAge inducers and inhibitors of senescence, and the oncogenes and TSGs [101]. Results for all overlap analyses were plotted using the ggplot2 library [90,102].

Simulation of CS gene expression in human aging

The RNA-seq gene expression data on GTEx was scrambled in such a way that all protein-coding genes in each tissue were assigned a random paired p and log 2 FC value from the original gene expression data of each respective tissue. The randomly sorted gene expression data was then filtered for significance (p < 0.05, moderated t-test with BH correction, absolute log 2 FC > log 2 (1.5)) [32,103], and the CellAge accessions were extracted and overlapped across all the simulated expression data in 26 tissues from GTEx. The probability of a CS gene being overexpressed or underexpressed across multiple tissues by chance was calculated across 10,000 simulations.

Functional enrichment

The analysis of CellAge included gene functional enrichment of the database. We used DAVID functional clustering (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) to identify functional categories associated with CellAge [35,36].

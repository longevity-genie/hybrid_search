(b) LRR domain horseshoe architecture illustrated on the only plant NLR cryo-EM structure available-ZAR1-from Arabidopsis thaliana (left) and zoom-in view of a LRR repeat (right) (PDB: 6J5W). The hydrophobic positions in the minimal 'L0xxL3xL5' motif are shown in orange. The first N-entry repeat (blue) and the last C-exit repeat (red) are also mapped on the structure. (c) Phyla distribution of the initial LRR motif set ID90, the 50% identity trimmed LRR motifs set (ID50), annotated LRR proteins and all proteins from the UniRef50 database (from left to right). Percent values corresponding to the mammals group are shown in red. (d) Frequency plot of amino acid composition of the N-entry, core and C-exit motifs on the 50% identity trimmed set. Amino acids are colored according to their properties as follows: hydrophobic (yellow), acidic (red), basic (blue), asparagine and glutamine (purple), proline and glycine (green), others (black).

Figure 4 . 4LRRpredictor behavior on Interpro annotated LRR domains from different classes. (a) Length distribution of the predicted repeats using LRRpredictor within each protein group. Cterminal motifs were not used in computing the distribution. Repeat lengths size prone to ambiguity-i.e., either too short (potential FP) or too long (potential FN)-are shaded in red. (b) Distributions of the Interpro annotated LRR domain length that is covered by Interpro LRR repeat annotations (grey) or by predicted repeats using LRRpredictor (blue), LRRfinder (green), and LRRsearch (purple). Coverage percent distributions are shown within each protein group.

Figure 5 . 5Consensuses of the LRR motifs predicted by LRRpredictor across different classes. Logo heights correspond to amino acid relative entropy (in bits), higher heights implying higher conservation. A consensus for each class is displayed bellow each logo, highly conserved positions being shown in black boxes, while less conserved in gray. Minimal motif 'L0xxL3xL5' (green line) and the extended motif (black line) are indicated below each logo. Amino acids are colored according to their properties as inFigure 1d.

Figure 7 . 7LRR motifs variability in different protein classes. (a) Intra-group all-vs.-all distances on the extended (left) and minimal (right) motif (b) Silhouette coefficients inter-groups extended (left) and minimal (right) motif. (c) Histogram of a 2D embedding approximating the true distances between points for the extended (left) and minimal (right) motif. Histograms were computed using a 20 × 20 bins grid. Extended and minimal motif histograms cannot be compared as they refer to different sequence spaces.

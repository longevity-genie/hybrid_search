An important observation in our study was that the majority of manipulations on LAG orthologs in more than one model animal resulted in concordant effects on longevity (Fig. 5). This strengthens the paradigm of 'public' longevity pathways and of using model animals to study longevity, even across a large evolutionary distance. This notion is further strengthened when combined with the observation of Smith et al. (2008) who demonstrated that the existence of an ortholog is probably accompanied by a preserved role in longevity. Yet, we also observed LAGs with ortholog presence only in a limited number of taxa, or that displayed discordant effects when tested in more than one species (Fig. 5), which could, at least in part, be attributed to 'private' mechanisms of aging. Definitely, more comparative studies are warranted to better discriminate between private and public mechanisms, with unified methods of intervention and evaluation in mind. A recent study by Harel et al. (2015) could serve as a step in that direction by offering a new model of short-lived vertebrate species. In perspective, the combination of the existing data on LAGs with the emerging data on their expression throughout lifespan could bring about a deeper understanding of the role of genetic factors in aging and longevity.

Experimental procedures Gene lists

Longevity-associated genes The longevity-associated genes (LAGs) are defined as genes whose genetic manipulation in model organisms (M. musculus, D. melanogaster, C. elegans and S. cerevisiae) was shown to significantly affect their lifespan. The list was obtained from Human Ageing Genomic Resources (HAGR)-GenAge database (http://genomics.senescence.info/gene s/longevity.html; Tacutu et al., 2013).

Interactome genes

Interactome genes were extracted from the BioGrid database (http:// www.thebiogrid.org; Chatr-Aryamontri et al., 2015) and were used as additional, high quality control for a more rigorous testing of the evolutionary conservation of LAGs.

Essential genes

Genes essential for the development and growth of C. elegans were extracted from WormBase (http://www.wormbase.org/; Howe et al., 2016).

Stress response genes

Genes classified under the category of 'stress response' were extracted by the UniProt Retrieve ID/Mapping service (http://www.uniprot.org/ uploadlists/; Pundir et al., 2017) Determination of orthology Ortholog determination for each gene was based on the InParanoid database-Eukaryotic Ortholog Groups (http://inparanoid.sbc.su.se/; Sonnhammer & Ostlund, 2015). The analysis was performed for 205 species (all species available excluding parasites; for a full list, see Table S1). The ortholog extraction was performed automatically using software developed in our laboratory. The taxonomy of the species examined was based on the ITIS database (http://www.itis.gov/). The statistical significance of conservation for a group of genes was evaluated with the chi-squared goodness of fit test.

Gene set enrichment

Enrichment analysis was performed using David Bioinformatics Resources 6.8 (https://david-d.ncifcrf.gov/; Huang et al., 2009), Web-Gestalt (http://www.webgestalt.org/; Wang et al., 2013), and EnrichR (http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/; Kuleshov et al., 2016). The enrichment analysis was performed against three different backgrounds, including the whole genome, all LAGs, and the genes of the model organism under the same conservation criteria depicted in Tables S4-S6.

(a) Saccharomyces cerevisiae, n = 6590 for control, 824 for all LAGs, and 277 for LSE-LAGs. (b) C. elegans, n = 20 325 for control, 733 for all LAGs, 491 for LSE-LAGs, 127 for PD RNAi LAGs, and 107 for PD RNAi LSE-LAGs. (c) Drosophila melanogaster, n = 13 250 for control, 136 for all LAGs, and 85 for LSE-LAGs. (d) Mus musculus, n = 21 895 for control, 112 for all LAGs, and 42 for LSE-LAGs. The vast majority of pairwise differences between LAGs and the entire proteome are significant (P < 0.05), with a few exceptions of fringe cases as described in the text. For most M. musculus LSE-LAGs, the pairwise differences are insignificant (P > 0.05), with a few exceptions where the number of orthologs was relatively high. Longevity genes and interventions, H.

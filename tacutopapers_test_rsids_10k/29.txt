Human A comprehensive set of genes potentially associated with human ageing. The list contains genes that have been directly linked to ageing in humans, as well as the best candidate genes, supported by different types of evidence in model organisms, cells and/or functional analyses. Models A set of genes in model organisms (predominantly from Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) shown to significantly affect lifespan through genetic manipulations. Microarray A list of genes commonly altered during mammalian ageing from a meta-analysis of microarray studies (13).

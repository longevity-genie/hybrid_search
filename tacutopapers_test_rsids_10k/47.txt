Evolutionary conservation of CS genes was analyzed using the InParanoid7 -Eukaryotic Ortholog Groups database ( [34], http://inparanoid.sbc.su.se). To exclude inparalogs, we have used the default threshold score of 0.05. Essentiality of human genes was evaluated based on the data on mouse lethal phenotypes, which were retrieved from the Mouse Genome Informatics database ( [89], www.informatics.jax.org). Functional and pathway analyses were performed with the tools provided by DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.7 ( [90,91], http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov) using data from the KEGG database ( [92], http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ pathway.html) and Gene Ontology ( [93], http://www.geneontology.org). Protein-protein interacttion (PPI) data from the BioGRID database ( [27], http://thebiogrid.org), human interactome release 3.1.71, was used for the analysis of connectivity and interconnectivity. The largest fraction of proteins which forms a continuous network was used as a measure of interconnectivity. To generate control data, simulations with sets of randomly selected proteins from the interactome were performed. The size of protein sets ranged from 50 to 8000 genes, with a step of 50. In each case, one hundred simulations were run and the relation between the size of the set and the fraction of genes interconnected by chance was quantified. The simulations and the creation of the microRNA-regulated PPI CS network were done using YABNA (Yet Another Biological Networks Analyzer).

The YABNA software program and the algorithm for the construction of miRNA-regulated PPI networks have been previously described in detail ( [24,25], http://www.netageproject.org). The graphical output of the CS miRNAregulated PPI network was generated using Cytoscape 2.8.0 ( [94], http://www.cytoscape.org/). The statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) software was used for the statistical evaluation of the results. Significance of the difference between mean values was calculated using the Student's t-test. The difference between observed and expected values was evaluated using the chi-square test. Pearson's coefficient of correlation was used for pairwise correlative analysis. Differences were considered significant at p-value less than 0.05. Statistical analysis of the enrichment of GO categories and KEGG pathways was carried out using DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.7 ( [90,91], http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov), with Bonferroni correction.

Figure 2 . 2MicroRNA-regulated cellular senescence PPI network. Genes are depicted as red circles and miRNAs as green squares.

Figure 3 . 3Fraction of genes which are essential to growth and development in each of the gene sets under analysis. The difference between each set and all genes (control) was highly significant (p < E-25). Insert: The correlation between essentiality and average connectivity (R -Pearson's coefficient of correlation; p = 0.004).

Figure 4 . 4Evolutionary conservation of human CS genes. The difference between CS genes and all genes in InParanoid was significant for D. rerio (p = 0.0001), X. tropicalis (p = 0.003), G. gallus (p = 0.002), R. norvegicus (p = 0.006) and M. musculus (p = 0.02).

Figure 5 . 5Enrichment of genes involved in ARDs and agingassociated conditions among CS genes. The fold-increase was computed as the ratio between the number of observed genes vs. the expected value. In all cases, the fold-increase was highly significant (p < E-25).

Figure 6 . 6Common pathways enriched across CS and ARDs. Pathways directly involved in specific pathologies were excluded in order to remove bias. See also Suppl.

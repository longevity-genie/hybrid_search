; 80.7% (21/26) increased p16; 96.2% increased p21 (25/26); 65.4% increase IL-6; and 65.4% (17/ 26) increase SA-β-galactosidase. Of the siRNAs that resulted in a decrease in Ki67 index, 61.9% (13/21) were classified as top hits as they concomitantly decreased cell number and altered at least one morphological measure. 92.3% (12/13) of the top hits activated both the p16 and p21 pathway, 84.6% (11/13) upregulated the SASP factor IL-6, while 61.5% (8/13) generated an increase in the percentage of SA-β-galactosidase positive cells. In general, we have shown the power of networks in predicting gene function, with 13 "top hits" (GTF3C4, C9orf40, HAUS4, MCM7, TCEB3, CDC25A, CDCA4, CKAP2, MTHFD2, NEK2, IMMT, MYBL2, and NIPA2).

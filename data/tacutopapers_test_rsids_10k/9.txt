The linear model used for the explanatory analysis of the final selection of genes was a Bayesian organ-wise multilevel model with random coefficients. A normal likelihood, uninformative normal prior for each coefficient, and a gamma uninformative prior for the precision parameter, were used. The regression parameters were fitted using the Gibbs sampling algorithm implemented in the R Package RJags [77]. The ORQ transformation method [78] was used to do a "transform-both-sides" regression with the imputed dataset since the variables (i.e., gene expressions) and the target variable (i.e., MLS) were nonnormal. The penalized deviance (2e4 iterations) for the multilevel models with the top 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 genes was 770.5, 661.7, 639.3, 563.4, 556.3, 545.9, 554.6, 523.8, 491.6, 497.2 and 497.9, respectively. Based on this, the threshold was set to the top 11 genes for the multilevel model. For the single-level model, the penalized deviance was 452.4 for that same selection of genes. The Gibbs sampling algorithm was run using 3 chains, 20e3 iterations, and a burnout period of 1e3 iterations. Finally, for explanatory purposes, we included a column in Table 1 to show the genes that were considered to be significantly involved in the multilevel regression for each organ (i.e., only those whose coefficients' probability of being greater or less than zero is greater than the threshold 0.70), except for the all-organs regression wherein we include all 11 genes.

Explanatory LightGBM-SHAP Model for Composite Integration

Using the composite ranking and an elbow plot to select the threshold (Supplementary Figure S4), the 15 genes with the highest impact for all models were selected. Multiple LightGBM-SHAP models were then fitted with different numbers of top-ranked genes as features, from top-5 to top-15 genes. For those models, we used the same methodology and species partitioning as in the stage II model. The sequential comparison of the accuracy of those models showed that a significant decrease in Huber loss (loss decrease = 0.8) was present during the transition from top-5 to top-6 genes models opposite to a flat decrease after adding more genes to the model (max loss decrease = 0.29). Thus, the top-6 genes model was considered most significant, having the lowest number of genes while having the highest increase in model performance.

Concluding Remarks

In this work, transcriptomic data from 41 mammalian species were analyzed, using both linear and non-linear organ-specific models. Overall, more than 1800 genes were found to correlate linearly with MLS in at least one of the studied organs. Remarkably, some of these relationships are universal in multiple organs; however, for many other genes, the mechanisms seem to be limited to only some organs. Many of the genes that correlate both with metabolic variables and MLS seem to be expressed in the brain, whereas the liver has the largest number of genes that are associated with MLS independently of other confounders. Pathway enrichment shows that some of the genes found in the analysis are involved in longevity-related biological pathways; however, other pathways, less described or studied so far in relation to aging, also surface and might be of interest.

Using the LightGBM-SHAP and Bayesian networks models, we found gene signatures formed by only a few genes that are highly predictive towards MLS. Interestingly, the genes that we found in signatures are not directly related to each other and belong to different pathways. Remarkably, not many genes that correlate with MLS across mammals are known LAGs, though some LAGs identified in interventional studies do overlap with our results. This is somewhat expected as LAGs are usually found experimentally by knockout or overexpression, and do not necessarily impact species MLS through their expression level. Even so, many of the genes found in our analysis, whose expressions potentially determine mammalian MLS, seem to be directly or indirectly involved in longevity-associated processes. Through a combination of linear, non-linear and Bayesian networks, our analysis highlights novel potential longevity regulators in mammals. This approach could have particular significance for predicting new longevity regulators, analyzing the links between determinants of longevity and associated processes, and studying the mechanisms of aging and longevity.

), improving the metrics for MLS prediction from Huber loss = 3.92, MAE = 4.733, MSE = 64.87 and R 2 = 0.90 in the stage I model to Huber loss = 2.4, MAE = 3.04, MSE = 36.8 and R 2 = 0.95 in the stage II model (outputting 57 genes). Interestingly, several genes included in the stage II model (17 out of 155, slightly enriched, non-significant, p = 0.17) are also orthologous to known LAGs recorded in the GenAge database [3]: GNAS, FXN, TERT, MSRA, XRCC6, UQCRB, MEMO1, NEIL1, RPS8, COX7C, RXRB, EIF4EBP1, RCL1, PCBP2, EIF3K, PKN3, CLHC1.

Figure 3 . 3SHAP values and interactions of the top 15 genes with the highest predicted contribution to MLS. (a) SHAP summary plot of the impact values for the topmost predictive genes of MLS, based on their gene expression levels. Each dot represents an individual sample in the model, with the horizontal position showing the impact (in years) on the MLS prediction. Colors show the expression of a particular gene in comparison to its baseline expression level across all samples: from blue (lower) to red (higher). Genes are sorted in decreasing order based on the feature importance (mean of the absolute values of impact). (b) SHAP decision plot. Each sample's MLS prediction is represented by a colored line. At the top of the plot, each line intersects the X-axis at its corresponding predicted MLS. The color of the fragmented line is defined by the position on the X-axis, the predicted MLS (from blue-short-lived species, to red-long-lived species). At the bottom of the plot, the lines will converge at the baseline value (21.6 years), which is an estimation of the average model prediction obtained if all genes used by the stage II model are added. Moving from the bottom of the plot to the top, SHAP values for each feature are added to the model's baseline value. This shows how each gene contributes to the MLS prediction in a layer-wise, propagating manner. (c) The interaction effect (in years) showing stronger or weaker values between pairs of the topmost interacting genes.

Each cell depicts the added or subtracted predicted impact (measured in years) that a combination of two genes has, compared to the sum of their individual effects: from blue (lower interaction effect) to red (higher interaction effect). The intensity of the effect (given by the color) does not take into account the direction of the interaction (positive/negative). (d) SHAP heatmap plot with the model's predictions for all samples. Each value on the X-axis represents a sample. Genes are displayed on the Y-axis, with SHAP values for genes in samples being encoded from blue (lower) to red (higher). The model's predictions are shown on the top panel (MLS = f(x)), sorted by the MLS value in descending order. The global importance of the genes is shown as black bars on the right side of the figure.

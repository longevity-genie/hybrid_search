Silencing of ife-2 on the other hand, extended the lifespan of daf-16 mutants ( Figure 1E; mean lifespan 9.8% greater), although the mean and maximum lifespan were not completely reverted to the lifespan values of the WT (mean and maximum lifespan 5.3% and 4.2% lower than WT, respectively). The lifespan of the triple daf-16; odr-3; ife-2 inactivated animals did not significantly differ from daf-16 single mutants. This could be partly explained by the fact that DAF-16 is one of the main transducers of signaling pathways modulated by ODR-3 and IFE-2 activity. To clarify this aspect we examined the nuclear translocation of DAF-16::GFP in odr-3(n1605), ife-2(RNAi) and odr-3(n1605); ife-2(RNAi) animals, respectively (Supplementary Figure 2). Whereas odr-3(n1605) animals showed weak DAF-16::GFP nuclear accumulation in posterior intestinal cells, suggesting that ODR-3 could affect longevity partially through DAF-16 pathway, we did not observe consistent nuclear accumulation of DAF-16::GFP in ife-2(RNAi) and odr-3(n1605); ife-2(RNAi) animals. Therefore, ODR-3 and IFE-2 could AGING affect lifespan by mediating parallel signaling pathways, which in the daf-16 background have antagonistic effects -odr-3 further decreasing lifespan and ife-2 partially increasing the daf- 16(mu86) lifespan.

In contrast to a previous study that reported a slight decrease of daf-16(m26) lifespan by cku-70 knockdown at 25° C [46], in our experiments the lifespan of daf-16; cku-70 at 20° C was similar to that of daf-16 single mutants, and cku-70 knock-down did not significantly influence the lifespan of daf-16; odr-3, nor of daf-16; ife-2 mutants ( Figure 1F, 1G). The quadruple daf-16; odr-3; ife-2; cku-70 mutants exhibited a lifespan similar to that of daf-16 single mutants ( Figure 1H).

Overall, our results show that simultaneous inactivation of odr-3 and ife-2 produce an additive lifespan effect, while the additional cku-70 knock-down does not extend lifespan further ( Figure 2). Since the lifespan effects observed are different in the daf-16 background (Figure 2), it is possible that the mechanisms through which odr-3; ife-2 animals achieve lifespan extension overlap with the pleiotropic mechanisms determined by daf-16 ( Figure 2).

The ife-2(ok306) mutation also extends the lifespan of odr-3(n1605) mutant animals

One question is whether the ife-2(ok306) deletion mutation will produce similar effects as the ife-2(RNAi) in the odr- 3(n1605) background. To answer this, we also generated the double odr-3(n1605); ife-2(ok306) and triple daf-16(mu86); odr-3(n1605); ife-2(ok306) mutants and conducted further lifespan assays. The mutant worms were cultured at the same temperature (20° C) as in the RNAi experiments and were fed OP50 bacteria. We observed similar trends ( Figure 3A), i.e. a 13.6% and 35.7% increase in mean and maximum lifespan for the odr-3; ife-2 double mutant, compared to wild type, and an additive effect of the single mutations (the 13.6% increase in mean lifespan was comparable with the sum of the individual genetic effects of odr-3 and ife-2 mutations: 7.5% and 4.5%). It was however noticeable that in this experiment the impact of the double mutation on lifespan was smaller than in the case of ife-2(RNAi), which used an HT115 diet.

Since FUdR could cause an artefactual effect on the longevity of some mutants [49][50][51], we also conducted longevity experiments in the absence of FUdR. Similar to the previous results, we also observed an increased average lifespan for all strains even in the absence of FUdR ( Figure 3B, odr-3:+8.2%, ife-2:+8.6% and odr-3;ife-2:+14.3%).

Next, we investigated the effect of the odr-3(n1605) and ife-2(ok306) mutations in the daf- 16 and triple daf-16(mu86); odr-3(n1605); ife-2(ok306) mutants showed very similar lifespans as that of the daf-16 ( Figure 3C).

The odr-3; ife-2 impaired animals display increased motility and pharyngeal pumping

Our finding that RNAi impairment of ife-2 in odr-3(n1605) animals increased lifespan prompted us to investigate the effect of their inactivation on healthspan. To assess healthspan, we focused on the evaluation of pharyngeal pumping and body movement. In C. elegans, these two physiological processes decrease with ageing, correlate between themselves and with other age-related declining properties, and ultimately can predict lifespan and healthy life [52].

In our experiments, up to late adulthood, individual or joint interventions in odr-3 and ife-2 did not produce obvious pathological changes in the phenotype, indicating that the effect on locomotion was caused by physiological age-related changes, rather than a specific disease. As such, the observed motility status, carried out along the lifespan assay, can be viewed as a measure of the healthspan of the population. To quantify this, we classified individuals in three motion stages based on their ability to move. Stage A (healthy, fully mobile worms) included animals in a physiological state that could move without any impediment, stage B (impaired worms) included animals with diminished locomotion, whereas stage C (frail worms) included animals found in a frailty state. Animals were scored daily and associated with one of the motion stages. The distribution of stages for each strain is presented graphically in Figure 4A-4D (for Considering the average healthspan of worms in stage A, we observed a similar trend to lifespan. Simultaneous inactivation of odr-3 and ife-2 produced a synergistic healthspan effect, while the additional cku-70 knock-down does not extend healthspan further (Supplementary Figure 4).

Using the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate the fraction of mobile worms at each observation point, plotted against time, the average number of days the worms spent in each state was computed ( Figure 4E and Supplementary Table 2). This allowed us to model the transitions from the healthy to impaired or frail (see Materials and methods), thus, determining if a change in the locomotion status was induced by the genetic interventions and whether in addition to lifespan, the ratio between healthspan and lifespan was also changed.

The WT animals spent on average 17.3 days in the mobile stage, which represent 84% of their mean lifetime, 1.5 days (7.3%) in an impaired stage and 1.8 days (8.7%) in the frailty stage. The odr-3 mutants remained mobile longer than WT animals (on average 20.8 days), however relative to their mean lifespan, they were fully mobile only for 80.0% of their lifetime, thus exhibiting a proportional (or greater) lifespan fraction in which they were impaired or frail (2.6 days, 10.0%, for both). ife-2 RNAi treated animals remained mobile on average more days (21.0 days, 86.4%) and exhibited a similar number of impaired (1.6 days, 6.6%) and frail days (1.7 days, 7.0%) (Supplementary Table 2).

For the odr-3; ife-2 animals, the longest-lived strain in our study, a corresponding increase of days with full (25.0 days, 86.5%) and impaired motility (2.2 days, 7.6%) was observed, while the number of days of frailty remained similar as for WT animals (1.7 days, 5.9%).

Next, we compared each fraction of being fully mobile with the corresponding fraction in the WT animals to find if the genetic interventions indeed conferred significant benefits for the quality of life, i.e. increasing the fraction of time spent in a mobile state and decreasing the impaired and frailty fractions. By doing this, we found that although the odr-3 mutants had extended longevity, this was not associated with a motility-based health benefit since the lifespan fraction in which worms lived as fully mobile actually decreased slightly by 4.8% (Supplementary Table 2), whereas the fraction of time spent in both the impaired and frailty stages increased by almost 40%. By contrast, ife-2 RNAi treated animals stayed mobile for a similar lifespan fraction as WT animals (3% longer), but they spent much less time as impaired or frail (these fractions were 9.6% and 19.5%, respectively, smaller than those for WT). Compared to WT control animals, silencing of ife-2 in odr-3 worms did not affect the mean lifespan fraction spent in the mobile and impaired stages, but decreased the lifespan fraction for the frailty period by more than 30%.

To assess the significance of the changes in motility status, the Kaplan-Meier curves modeling the transitions from mobile to impaired and frailed were used and the relevant comparisons are included in the Supplementary Figure 5C To further determine whether healthspan is affected, we analyzed the decline of pharyngeal pumping with age, a process controlled by the cardiac-like pharyngeal muscle. As seen in Figure 4F, the number of pharyngeal movements strongly decreases with age in all cohorts.

The changes for both single mutants, odr-3(n1605) and ife-2(ok306), are similar to those in the WT (no statistically significant difference observed when comparing to WT, at each day; one-way ANOVA). The odr-3(n1605); ife-2(ok306) double mutant showed a slower decline in pharyngeal contractions and a higher rate of pumping compared to WT. The improved healthspan was observed starting from day 5, when the average number of contractions was 17.8% higher than for WT (p = 0.002), and slightly increased, at day 10 being 21.4% higher (p = 0.14; ns). At day 15, the odr-3;ife-2 animals still showed approximately 42 contractions per minute (compared to 15 contractions per minute in the WT), a 187% increase (p <E-04). On day 15, the odr-3(n1605) and ife-2(ok306) mutations showed a synergistic effect on the pharyngeal pumping, the increase observed in the double mutant being higher than the sum of the individual effects (187% increase compared to 66% + 55% increase for single mutants), corresponding to a fully synergic effect [18].

The common SMs are presented in the reprogramming cocktails in descending order: CHIR99021 = RepSox (n = 7), VPA = Forskolin (n = 6), Parnate (n = 5), DZNep (n = 4), AM 580 (n = 3), EPZ004777 (n = 2); other SMs are found only in one cocktail (see Table 1).

KEGG pathways enrichment analysis of SM targets

To get further insight into the mechanisms of chemically-induced reprogramming, we carried out an enrichment analysis for SM protein targets. For that purpose, we first used the STITCH database (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26590256/) for extracting the chemical-protein interactions. Then, using the DAVID bioinformatics tools [22], we determined the enriched KEGG pathways of the found SM protein targets (in total, 1023). Figure 2 depicts the most enriched KEGG categories (p < 0.001 after Benjamini correction, with at least two-fold enrichment) among SM targets (for a full list of the enriched pathways, see Supplementary Table 7).

The most significantly enriched KEGG pathways include pathways associated with regulation of longevity such as mTOR signaling (p = 9.1E-18), AMPK signaling (p = 5.7E-17), Insulin signaling (p = 2.3E-13), FoxO signaling (p = 4.2E-23), and pathways involved in cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions (Focal adhesion, p = 3.7E-13, Adherens junction, p = 5.4E-06). Also, SM targets are overpresented in the signaling pathways associated with age-related diseases, including different types of cancer, type II diabetes mellitus (p = 7.7E-08), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (p = 2.3E-04), and Alzheimer's disease (p = 2.5E-03). Among the enriched pathways are numerous growth-promoting pathways, cell survival (PI3K-Akt, p = 3.9E-19) or cell death (Apoptosis, p = 1.7E-18) signaling. Many enriched pathways are related to immune and inflammatory responses. Among them are the pathways related to innate immunity (Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, p = 1.8E-09; NK-cell mediated cytotoxicity, p = 2.6E-06), specific immune responses (T cell receptor signaling pathway, p = 5.3E-15; B cell receptor signaling pathway, p = 2.1E-07), and inflammatory signaling (Chemokine signaling pathway, p = 1.5E-13; Adipocytokine signaling pathway, p = 2.1E-11), etc.

Not surprisingly, the enriched pathways include regulation of cell cycle (p = 3.5E-09), cell differentiation (Neurotrophins, p = 3.3E-18; TGFβ signaling, p = 9.4E-06), and Signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells (p = 2.8E-06).

Network analysis of SM targets

To further evaluate to what extent the SM targets interact between themselves, we determined their AGING protein-protein interactions (PPIs), annotated in the BioGRID database [23]. These data are currently available for 991 out of 1023 SM target proteins. The analysis revealed that many of these targets interact with each other and exhibit multiple PPIs (in total, 6072 interactions). Remarkably, a significant fraction of the interacting SM targets (851 out of 991 proteins; 85.8%) forms a continuous network between themselves AGING ( Figure 3A). This fraction is significantly higher than expected by chance, i.e., higher than for the same number of randomly selected proteins with annotated PPIs ( Figure 3B) (random sampling, mean ± SD: 52.8 ± 3.5%; z-score for observed value: 9.37).

Next, we aimed to understand the topology of the constructed network. To address this point, we calculated the distribution of node connectivity. The regression equation in Figure 3C (P(k) = 221 x k -1. 16 ) follows a power-law distribution of connectivity and   AGING indicates that the PPI network of SM targets has a scalefree topology, with an extremely high contribution of hubs to the average network connectivity.

Using the same approach, we built the chemical-protein interaction and PPI networks for the ten SM cocktails used thus far for chemical reprogramming (see Supplementary Table 6). As seen in Figure 4 and Supplementary Figures 1-9, the total number of annotated protein targets in SM cocktails varied from 6 (Cocktail 10) to 174 (Cocktail 7), mostly falling around 50. In all cases, the fraction of proteins forming a continuous PPI network was extremely high (from 25% to 75.9%) for such small sizes of protein sets ( Figure  3B), z-scores computed after random sampling being between 5.33 and 30. Collectively, the results obtained indicate that the SM targets are highly interconnected.

Comparison of targets and pathways of SM cocktails with Yamanaka's factors

It seems plausible that the cocktails for chemical cell reprogramming and TFs for iP, specifically Yamanaka's factors (OSKM), have common targets ( Figure 5A).

However, their comparison showed that only the gene targets of Cocktail #7 (15 targets; p = 0.0033) overlap significantly with the targets of a "classical" combination of iP transcription factors ( Figure 5A). Other cocktails overlap insignificantly (p > 0.05) with OSKM. Of note, Cocktail #7 has much more targets than any other cocktail for chemical reprogramming. In contrast to specific targets, several cocktails (#2, 3, 4 and 7) have significantly overlapped pathways with OSKM ( Figure 5B). As seen in Table 2, most common pathways are cancer-related. Though not reaching the level of significance, the common pathways of other cocktails (#1, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10) are also cancer-related.

SMs as human metabolites

Most SMs are artificially synthesized chemicals. Of special interest is whether among the SMs are compounds that are natural (human) metabolites or their analogs. Overlapping the 92 SMs with the molecules found in the Human Metabolome Database -HMDB [24] gives a positive answer to this question: 28 compounds from the SM list are also found in HMDB ( Table 3). The overlap is statistically extremely significant AGING (p = 9.7E-83). For example, among SMs are essential natural metabolites (n = 8) including several vitamins (A, C, D), molecules belonging to fatty acids and their derivatives (NaB, PGE2), organooxygen (Fru-2,6-P2) and organonitrogen (Spermidine) compounds, and prenol lipids (Retinoic acid). Other "natural" SMs represent nutrients that integrate into the human body when consuming products of plant metabolism (n = 11). Interestingly, several of these compounds (e.g. EGCG, 7-hydroxyflavone, apigenin, curcumin, quercetin, resveratrol) are components of plant extracts that have been already shown to improve healthspan, in particular stress resistance and cognitive abilities [25]. Several SMs are medications, which under specific conditions can be found in the human body.

Although they are not the products of human metabolism or essential nutrients, most of them are analogs of natural metabolites. For example, 5'-azaC or 5'-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine are analogs of the nucleoside cytidine; N-acetyl-cysteine is metabolized into L-cysteine, a precursor to the biologic antioxidant glutathione; Valproic acid (VPA) is a branched shortchain fatty acid derived from the naturally occurring Valeric acid [26].

Furthermore, using STITCH tools [27], we found another 963 molecules that are similar (based on the STITCH drug similarity score) to the SMs that induce or enhance pluripotency, of them, 210 compounds (data not shown) are present in the Human Metabolome Database [24]. Among these compounds are neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine and GABA), fatty acids, and their derivatives involved in energy metabolism, such as citric acid, succinate and lactate. We determined the targets of these 210 chemicals, of the abovementioned eight human essential natural metabolites, and then compared them with the targets of all collected SMs (n = 1,023) and SM cocktails (n = 204) (Supplementary Table 10). As seen in the Supplementary Table 10, there is an extremely significant (p < E-25, Fisher test) overlap between the targets of the 210 SM-like chemicals (n = 4,614) and the targets of all SMs or the targets of SM cocktails. The common targets cover more than 76% (782 of 1023 targets) and 65% (132 out of 204 targets), respectively. Also, an extremely significant overlap was found for the targets of the abovementioned 8 human natural metabolites (n = 318) and the targets of SM cocktails (21%, 43 of 204).

AGING

DISCUSSION

Until now, the selection of SMs for chemically-induced pluripotency or cell reprogramming was done mainly on an empirical basis, and no analysis of SMs and their targets has been undertaken. Several reviews published in the past [28][29][30][31][32] focused on specific aspects of SMs but none of them provided a "systemic" view. Our comprehensive data mining with subsequent data curation revealed 92 SMs that have been reported in connection to cell reprogramming. Most of the SMs were primarily used as enhancers of iP, i.e., for increasing the efficiency of cocktails containing TFs (e.g., Yamanaka's factors) [30,33,34]. Of note, to a lesser degree, SMs were also used as enhancers of cell reprogramming in SM cocktails without TFs. Apart from cell dedifferentiation, in the last years, SMs have also been used for cell transdifferentiation (for a review see Xie et al., 2017 [13]). Still, we found among the studied SMs many that could be classified as stand-alone inducers of cell reprogramming. These SMs were able to induce cellular reprogramming by themselves, thus either fully replacing the essential TFs [9,10] or by increasing their expression [35,36]. For example, Forskolin can replace Oct4, while RepSox can substitute Sox2 (see Supplementary Table 1).

Besides the classical iP by means of the combinations of overexpressed TFs (e.g., Yamanaka's factors, OSKM), a total of ten cocktails that contain SMs only with cell reprogramming activity have been established and tested thus far.

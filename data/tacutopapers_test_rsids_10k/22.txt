Analysis of the TiRe dataset of skin wound healing-associated genes showed that skin wound healing genes are (i) over-conserved among vertebrates, but are under-conserved in invertebrates; (ii) enriched in extracellular and immunoinflammatory genes; and display (iii) high interconnectivity and connectivity to other proteins.

INTRODUCTION

Tissue repair (often referred to as wound healing [WH]) is an inherent feature of any multicellular organism. Its major goal is to restore the integrity (and ideally function) of a damaged tissue. Some species from diverse taxa (such as salamander, axolotle, hydra, and several others [1]) and early mammalian embryos are able to fully regenerate damaged tissues/organs [2]. In mammals, however, this ability is drastically reduced after birth and continues to decline with age [2,3]. For most organs, this reduced regenerative capacity is in fact a normative response, favoring speed over functional restoration, so that regular tissue repair results in scar formation [2]. Deviations from regular tissue repair may lead to diverse pathological conditions, from slow or ineffective wound healing to hyper-fibroproliferative responses [4,5], both of which are often observed in advanced ages. Thus, factors that govern tissue repair are strongly associated with aging and age-related pathologies, and as such are potential gerotargets.

Recent years have brought about a huge amount of data regarding regular and abnormal wound healing. However, despite the accumulated knowledge, modulation of wound healing is still a major biomedical challenge [6]. This problem is expected to become even more challenging considering the phenomenon of population www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget aging. Therefore, there is an essential need to collect and systematically organize what we know about tissue repair and, in particular, what we know about its key genetic and molecular players.

With this in mind, we have created TiRe (Tissue Repair), a publicly available and manually curated database of factors that were identified as having a role in the wound healing process. An attempt to create a database on this subject, the "Compendium of Genetically Modified Mouse Wound Healing Studies", was undertaken in the past [4] but is unfortunately no longer available. Here, we have revived this important initiative, and updated and extended the data by including additional model organisms and humans.

The current build of the database is focused on skin wound healing, based on the following considerations: (i) the skin is the most frequently injured tissue, and its quick repair is vital for the organism [7,8]; (ii) the basic events during skin repair have much in common across a variety of wounded organs [9]; (iii) due to its accessibility, the skin is more suitable for experimentation than other organs; (iv) the rate of skin wound healing is often used as a biomarker of mammalian aging [10, and references therein]. Altogether, these make the skin a widely used model system for studying the intricate process of wound healing [11,12]. Not surprisingly, the amount of data on wound healing in the skin is superior to most organs, and is constantly increasing.

In the long run, we aim for TiRe to be a onestation resource that provides researchers and clinicians with the essential data needed for a better understanding of the mechanisms of wound healing, designing new experiments, and the development of new therapeutic strategies.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Overview of experimental models used to establish wound healing-associated genes (WHAGs)

There is a great variety of methods available for the study of skin wound healing (WH), both with regard to types of genetic interventions and wounding assays [11]. In our dataset, the dominant interventions used in the mouse model are genetic (i.e. knockout or overexpression), whereas other interventions, such as protein administration, are more common in the other species (Table 1). As seen in Table 2, the most common wounding method by far is the dorsal full-thickness excision model.

Characterization of WHAGs

The TiRe data collection offers an opportunity to gain insight into the features of WHAGs. Most of these genes were identified in the mouse model. Notably, genes that were studied in rats, swine and humans were also studied in mice, and some in more than two species (Table  3). Despite the differences in intervention and wounding methods, targeting the common genes across the species mostly led to consistent results, i.e. to concordant effects. This suggests that WH across these species has much in common.

WHAGs are differentially conserved across vertebrates and invertebrates

To broaden this perspective, we further investigated the evolutionary conservation of WHAGs. For that purpose, we extracted the WHAG orthologs for all species available in the InParanoid database [13]. As seen in Figure 1, WHAGs are over-conserved among vertebrates, but are under-conserved in invertebrates (for specific details, see Suppl. Table 1). This implies that (i) many of the skin WHAGs are a relatively recent acquisition in the course of evolution; and (ii) despite the significant differences in the anatomy and physiology of the skin between vertebrate species and the resulting differences in wound healing [14], the genetic basis of WH is conserved among vertebrates.

WHAGs are enriched in extracellular and immuno-inflammatory pathways

Complementary to the results above, our enrichment analysis on WHAGs sheds further light on this vertebratespecific evolutionary conservation. As seen in Figure  2A, WHAGs predominantly encode for extracellular proteins and those involved in cell-cell/cell-ECM interactions. Furthermore, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlights a particular role for the focal adhesion pathway as well as for the ECM receptor interaction, regulation of actin cytoskeleton pathways, and various immune/inflammatory-related pathways ( Figure 2B). Remarkably, the pathways involved in immune and inflammatory responses are even more over-represented when considering the genes that are conserved only in vertebrates ( Figure 2C).

This was especially noted for the cytokinecytokine receptor interaction and the associated JAK-STAT signaling pathways, hematopoietic cell lineage, complement and coagulation cascade pathways, and the adipocytokine signaling pathway which are enriched only in genes unique to vertebrates. Altogether, the results point to the importance of immuno-inflammatory reactions in wound healing, in vertebrates in particular. This is in line with numerous studies showing the importance of the inflammatory phase and with the unique immunity profile and functionality of vertebrates [15,16].

WHAGs are highly interactive and form a protein-protein interaction network

High-quality curated datasets enable systematic computational analyses [33,34]. Since we are interested in learning more about the underlying processes and Fig. 1 a The CellAge database of CS genes. The main data browser provides functionality to filter by multiple parameters like cell line and senescence type, and select genes to view details and links with other aging-related genes on the HAGR website. b Breakdown of the effects all 279 CellAge genes have on CS, and the types of CS the CellAge genes are involved in. Genes marked as "Unclear" both induce and inhibit CS depending on biological context. Numbers above bars denote the total number of genes inhibiting, inducing, or having unclear effects on CS. c Functional enrichment of the nonredundant biological processes involving the CellAge genes (p < 0.05, Fisher's exact test with BH correction) (Additional file 1: Table S3). GO terms were clustered based on semantic similarities functionality shared by human CS genes, we started by exploring functional enrichment within the CellAge dataset.

Using the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery-DAVID Version 6.8 [35,36], we found that genes in CellAge are enriched with several clusters associated with Protein Kinase Activity, Transcription Regulation, DNA-binding, DNA damage repair, and Cell cycle regulation in cancer. In particular, genes that induce senescence were more associated with promoting transcription, while genes that inhibit senescence were more associated with repressing transcription. Furthermore, we found that inducers of senescence were significantly associated with VEGF and TNF signalling pathways (p < 0.01, Fisher's exact test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction) (Additional file 1: Table S1 and S2). WebGestalt 2019 was used to determine which nonredundant biological processes the CellAge genes are involved in, and REVIGO was used to cluster related processes (p < 0.05, Fisher's exact test with BH correction) [37,38]. A total of 298 categories were significantly enriched and clustered: Signal transduction by p53 class mediator; Aging; Protein localization to nucleus; DNAtemplated transcription, initiation; Epithelial cell proliferation; Cell growth; Rhythmic process; Cellular carbohydrate metabolism; Reactive oxygen species metabolism; Cytokine metabolism; Adaptive thermogenesis; Organic hydroxy compound metabolism; Methylation; Generation of precursor metabolites and energy ( Fig. 1c; Additional file 1: Table S3).

Evolutionary conservation of CellAge genes in model organisms

Next, we looked at the conservation of CellAge genes across a number of mammalian and non-mammalian model organisms with orthologues to human CellAge genes using Ensembl BioMart (Version 96) [39] in order to understand the genetic conservation of CS processes. There was a significantly higher number of human orthologues for CellAge genes than for other proteincoding genes in mouse, rat, and monkey, while nonmammalian species did not show significant conservation of CellAge genes (two-tailed z-test with BH correction) (Additional file 1: Table S4; Additional file 2: Fig. S1A). Interestingly, previous studies have found that longevityassociated genes (LAGs) are substantially overrepresented from bacteria to mammals and that the effect of LAG overexpression in different model organisms was mostly the same [40]. It remains unclear what the evolutionary origin of most of the CellAge genes is or why they are not present in more evolutionarily distant organisms. Unique evolutionary pressures could have played an important role in the evolution of CellAge genes in mammals. However, somatic cells in C. elegans and Drosophila are post mitotic and lack an equivalent CS process, which could explain why the CellAge genes are not conserved. We further compared the conservation of CellAge inducers and inhibitors of CS and found that while the inducers were significantly conserved in the mammal model organisms, the inhibitors were not (Additional file 2: Fig. S1B).

We also report the number of orthologous CellAge genes present in 24 mammal species using the OMA standalone software v. 2.3.1 algorithm [41] (Additional file 2: Fig. S1C). From 279 CellAge genes, we report 271 orthogroups (OGs) (Additional file 3). Twenty-two OGs were conserved in the 24 mammals, including the following genes: DEK, BRD7, NEK4, POT1, SGK1, TLR3, CHEK1, CIP2A, EWSR1, HDAC1, HMGB1, KDM4A, KDM5B, LATS1, MORC3, NR2E1, PTTG1, RAD21, NFE2L2, PDCD10, PIK3C2A, and SLC16A7 (Additional file 1: Table S5). Within the long-lived mammalian genomes analyzed (human, elephant, naked mole rat, bowhead whale, and little brown bat), we found 128 OG CellAge genes (Additional file 3; genomes available in Additional file 1: Table S6). However, finding OGs is dependent on genome quality and annotations, and higher-quality genomes would likely yield more OGs.

For the evolutionary distances, we found that the longlived species had similar distances to the other species, meaning the branch lengths for long-lived species are distributed throughout the phylogeny as expected in a random distribution (Additional file 2: Fig. S1D). This was the case when we analyzed the concatenated tree for the 271 CellAge OGs as well as when we analyzed the 22 individual CellAge genes conserved among all 24 mammalian species (Additional file 4).

CellAge vs human orthologues of longevity-associated model organism genes

To understand how senescence is linked to the genetics of aging processes, we looked at the intersection of CellAge genes and the 869 genes in the human orthologues of model organisms' longevity-associated genes (LAGs) dataset, collected based on quantitative changes in lifespan [34]. Like CellAge, where genes are classified based on whether their upregulation induces, inhibits, or has an unknown impact on CS, the longevity orthologues dataset also provides information on the effect of upregulation of its genes, namely whether it promotes (pro, 421) or inhibits (anti, 448) longevity (Additional file 1: Table S7; Additional file 2: Fig. S2).

The CS inducers statistically overlapped with the antilongevity genes and not with the pro-longevity genes (anti: n = 9,~6%, p = 1.42e−02; pro: n = 6,~4%, p = 1.40e−01, Fisher's exact test with BH correction). We noted an inverse result with the inhibitors of CS, where there was a much greater overlap between the CellAge inhibitors and the pro-longevity genes, resulting in the smallest p value of all the overlaps (n = 18,~15%, p = 2.61e−10, Fisher's exact test with BH correction). However, there was also a significant overrepresentation of genes inhibiting the CS process within the anti-longevity genes (n = 7,~6%, p = 2.41e−02, Fisher's exact test with BH correction). It is possible that some of the pathways the CS inhibitors are associated with increase longevity, whereas other pathways have anti-longevity effects. Overall, these results highlight a statistically significant association between CS and the aging process and suggest a potential inverse relationship between CS and longevity, at least for some pathways. Gene overlaps are available in Additional file 1: Table S8.

CellAge genes differentially expressed with age

In another work, we performed a meta-analysis to find molecular signatures of aging derived from humans, rats, and mice [42]. To investigate how the expression of CellAge genes changes with age, we looked for CellAge genes which either induce (153) or inhibit (121) senescence within the list of aging signatures. The genes overexpressed with age (449) had a significant overlap with the CellAge genes (CS inducers: n = 17,~11%, p = 6.58e−07; CS inhibitors: n = 9,~7%, p = 6.35e−03, two-tailed Fisher's exact test with BH correction) while the genes underexpressed with age (162) did not (CS inducers: n = 0, p = 8.57e−01; CS inhibitors: n = 3,~3%, p = 1.64e−01). The overexpressed genetic signatures of replicative CS (526) also significantly overlapped with the overexpressed signatures of aging (n = 60,~11%, p = 1.18e−23), but not the underexpressed signatures of aging (n = 3,~1%, p = 8.79e−01). Finally, the underexpressed signatures of replicative CS (734) did not significantly overlap with the overexpressed (n = 18,~3%, p = 8.79e−01) or underexpressed (n = 9,~1%, p = 3.26e−01) signatures of aging.

Given that 112 (40%) of CellAge genes have only been confirmed to control CS in fibroblasts, we repeated the above analyses using a subgroup of CellAge genes that have been shown to affect CS in other cell types. A total of 91 CellAge inducers of CS and 72 inhibitors were overlapped with the signatures of aging. The same overlaps were still significant after FDR correction, indicating that the differential expression of CellAge genes with age cannot exclusively be attributed to fibroblast idiosyncrasies (CS inducers overexpressed: n = 10,~11%, p = 1.50e−04; underexpressed: n = 0, p = 1. CS inhibitors overexpressed: n = 6,~8%, 1.34e−02; underexpressed: n = 2,~3%, p = 1.98e−01).

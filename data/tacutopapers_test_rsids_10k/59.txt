All data available at MitoAge have undergone a threestep validation: (i) the collected raw data from NCBI Ref-Seq was processed through our software and log files were generated; (ii) reports of errors and inconsistencies from log files were then manually curated; and finally (iii) additional tests for database consistency (e.g. duplicates, faulty values, etc.) were performed by the administrative tools in the MitoAge website. The list of errors and inconsistencies found in the mtDNA sequence annotations were reported to the NCBI admin and subsequently corrected by the NCBI team. Upon successful validation, the corrected data were uploaded into the MitoAge database and various statistical metrics were computed.

DATA CALCULATION

The compositional features of the mtDNA heavy strand (H-strand) were mostly considered (unless indicated otherwise), since the H-strand represents a primary target for the directional mutation pressure (20). For computing codon usage, data were taken from the complement of the coding strand and Thymine (T) was replaced with Uracil (U) (i.e. transforming it into the mRNA sequence). When combining multiple genes (e.g. when computing the total proteincoding genes), we append one gene to another and use the entire sequence for the analysis. In case of overlap between genes, we count the overlapping sequences only once for the computation of base composition, and we count them twice for the computation of codon usage and amino acids frequencies for each gene. Sequences are always analyzed from 5 to 3 (both for DNA and RNA).

AVAILABILITY

The MitoAge database is available at www.mitoage.org and www.mitoage.info, with the data made available under the permissive Creative Commons license, allowing data to be used in other analyses. There are options to either download the entire database or its parts, or to export specific results of the website. Feedback via email is welcome.

CONCLUSION

The MitoAge database is an integrated web resource for comparative analysis of mtDNA, with a special focus on animal longevity. Thus, it fills the gap in one of the 'hot spots' at the crossroad of aging research, evolutionary and mitochondrial biology. MitoAge novelties, together with a userfriendly interface, provide unique capabilities for in-depth investigation of: (i) the abundance of mtDNA bases and its variability across animal taxa with different MLS; (ii) the links between longevity and the mtDNA compositional features (total, region or gene-specific), including codon usage and amino acids frequency. Using the MitoAge database, we revealed more than 3780 statistically significant correlations between mtDNA features and animal longevity in different taxonomic groups. MitoAge could be also a useful supporting tool for building predictive models of animal longevity, involving mtDNA features.

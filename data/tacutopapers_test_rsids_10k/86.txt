We separated results from the WLN (Table S1), the C. elegans orthologs from the HLN (Table S2) and genes common to both sets to determine the functional efficacy of each selection (Table  S3). For this analysis, we considered only the primary results because the number of genes selected for inclusion in the longitudinal analysis was independent of these groupings. Results from each class are similar. Primary analysis detected lifespan phenotypes for 46% (32% long-lived, 14% short lived) of WLNspecific candidates (Table S1), 39% (24% long-lived, 15% shortlived) of HLN-specific candidates (Table S2) and 37% (21% longlived and 16% short-lived) of the candidates common to both groups (Table S3). Although the modest increase in efficacy with which the WLN predicted increased lifespan may indicate superior accuracy, failure to replicate that observation amongst shared LAGs suggests this is not the case. Importantly however, the orthologs of human interactors were similarly predictive with the interactors endogenous to C. elegans, underscoring the remarkable conservation of genes that regulate longevity as well as their protein-protein interactions.

We confirm 30 new LAGs identified through network analysis of C. elegans and human candidates. Our results are consistent with several empirical observations regarding genes found to regulate longevity in previous screens. First, in agreement with previous studies, we identify a strong association of developmental and lifespan-regulatory functions [7,17,18,19,28,42,43,44,45]. By uti-lizing PPI networks and applying developmental ontology filters, we identified new lifespan regulators with a 13-fold greater frequency than has been reported in previous genome-wide screens (5.08% of long-lived phenotypes vs. an average of 0.38% in two genome-wide screens [5,6]; Tables 3 and 4). This is particularly supportive of our approach because we excluded all previously identified LAGs, suggesting we achieved greater efficacy despite systematically omitting the most robust, and therefore most easily identified, LAG inactivations. The verification of new LAGs resulting from our analysis probably underestimates the total present in our candidate pool, as 56 gene inactivations that extend lifespan and 43 that decrease lifespan from our preliminary analysis were not retested longitudinally. Second, the selection of candidate LAGs from the HLN and WLN were similarly effective, suggesting that both LAGs and their PPIs are highly conserved. Third, we identify the inhibition of translation as a means of lifespan regulation, consistent with results from several laboratories [5,6,7,39,46].

Finally, our results demonstrate that as expected, previous screens for LAGs have not saturated the search for gene inactivations that influence longevity. This is the first study to experimentally test a large set of novel LAG predictions generated based on the concept of a longevity network. The future application of increasingly detailed biological networks to the study of aging/longevity and the potential to synergize those networks with experimental studies in C. elegans and other cardinal organisms are promising.

In summary, we reasoned that the first-order interacting partners of known LAGs would be more likely modulate the longevity than a random set of genes. We used previously constructed worm and human longevity networks to identify candidate lifespan regulatory genes [28]. We then narrowed this candidate gene set in a manner consistent with the principles of antagonistic pleiotropy by focusing on genes essential to development. By combining a network-based approach with the selection of genes required for development, we identified new lifespan regulatory genes at a frequency far exceeding that achieved in genome-wide screens. Though the effect of the new LAGs on lifespan is relatively modest, one can speculate that they might function in pathways or complexes that modulate core longevity functions. The interaction of genes identified in this screen with key nodes of the WLN is strongly suggestive in this regard ( Figure 3). This work establishes both specifically and in proof of concept that biological networks enriched with experimental data are empowered to generate valuable candidate gene sets. Such an approach may prove broadly applicable as a tool to improve the efficiency of screening efforts. Moreover, the applicability of our method across diverse organisms or phenotypes is limited only by the availability of sufficient data to construct relevant networks.

Figure 2 . 2Disruption of translation extends longevity in C. elegans. The gene inactivations found to extend lifespan by the greatest percentage function in translation. T23D8.3 is the C. elegans ortholog of human LTV1, which is required for the nuclear export and processing f the 40S ribosomal subunit. The ribosomal protein subunit rps-14 directly participates in the 40S ribosome and is required for translation. Mean lifespan extension following postdevelopmental inactivation of these genes in an enhanced RNAi strain, eri-1, is 26% for the LTV1 ortholog (dashed line) and16.6% for rps-14 (dotted line) in comparison to an empty vector RNAi control (solid line). The lifespan extension phenotypes of these genes are consistent with the phenotypes of other translation genes in our screen, including rps-12 and 3 RNA polymerases(Tables 1 and 2). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0048282.g002

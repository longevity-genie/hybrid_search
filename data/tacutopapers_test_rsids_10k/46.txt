This could be especially relevant to aging organisms since they display a persistent activation of growth-promoting pathways [13,51]. As such, senescent cells are likely to   Table 3. www.impactaging.com create a pro-inflammatory/tumorigenic microenvironment which promotes the development of agingassociated conditions (chronic inflammation and oxidative stress) and ARDs [6,51,53]. In addition, the formation of the "senescent" microenvironment could be greatly attributed to the pathways ensuring cell-cell and cell-ECM (extracellular matrix) interactions, such as "Focal adhesion" and "Regulation of actin cytoskeleton", which we also found to be significantly enriched across CS and ARDs (Fig. 6, Suppl. Table 3). In particular, the importance of these pathways in CS is highlighted by the fact that the downregulation of caveolin-1, a central regulator of focal adhesion kinase activity and actin stress fiber formation [54] resulted in the re-entry of senescent human fibroblasts into cell cycle and restoration of their clonogenic potential [55]. Remarkably, focal adhesion is among the most enriched pathways in the common signaling network for the major human ARDs and longevity [23].

Given the over-representation of growth-promoting and cell-cell/ECM contact pathways in CS, it was expected to see cancer-associated pathways in the enrichment list, since cell proliferation and growth promotion are intrinsic properties of the cancer cells. Indeed, the most overrepresented category in CS is "Pathways in cancer" followed by the pathways for specific forms of cancer, including "Bladder cancer", "Prostate cancer", "Colorectal cancer", "Chronic myeloid leukemia", "Glioma", "Melanoma", and others and tumor suppressor "p53 signaling" (Suppl. Table 3). It should however be kept in mind that the final outcome (CS or cancer) of activation or inhibition of these pathways depends on many additional factors, discussed in details elsewhere [21].

www.impactaging.com All the above mentioned signaling pathways are also involved in cellular response to stress, further linking CS with aging and ARDs. For example, the CSassociated Gadd45 proteins, prominent stress sensors, are involved in the determination of the stressed cell fate via interactions with p53, MAPK, mTOR and other growth-promoting signaling pathways (reviewed by Moskalev et al. [56]). An age-related decrease in Gadd45 inducibility could promote tumorigenesis, immune disorders and insulin resistance [56]. Depending on the severity of stress and activated gene modules, the CS-associated proteins could either mediate DNA repair with subsequent cell survival (quiescence or re-entry to cell cycle), or induce CS or apoptosis (for details see: [57]). A common event in the stressed cells is a down-regulation of insulin/IGF1-Akt-mTOR axis by up-regulated p53 [58][59][60][61][62][63][64]. The resultant temporary quiescence period allows the repair of the DNA damage and the return to the routine cell cycle. However, if the level of stress is too high and/or its duration is too long, the cell cycle arrest turns into CS or apoptosis [64][65][66][67]. The induction of CS is mediated by the reactivation of the initially repressed PI3K/Akt-mTOR pathway [68,69]. Of note, its activation is also considered a hallmark of organismal aging [8,70,71].

Accordingly, the inhibition of mTOR signaling with rapamycin decreased the hypertrophic phenotype of senescent cells in vitro [47,72], extended the lifespan and delayed cancer in mice, even when the treatment was initiated later in life [73]. Thus, the common signaling pathways and the very mechanisms of CS induction link it to aging and ARDs.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

Our study shows that CS is tightly interconnected to aging, longevity and ARDs, either by sharing common genes and regulators or by PPIs and eventually by common pathways. The identification of a common molecular basis is an important step towards understanding the relationships between all these conditions. The next natural step would be the integration of these data with gene/miRNA expression profiles. Such integration could further highlight the key players in linking CS and ARDs. However, this is not a trivial task as the vast majority of data concerning CS derives from in vitro studies on fibroblasts while ARDs are well studied in a variety of cells and in vivo systems. Broadening the CS investigation by including more cell types, 3D in vitro models and in vivo studies will help in developing a more holistic view on the CS phenomenon.

Our analysis also provides the basis for new predictions since the genes common to both cancer and other ARD(s) are highly likely candidates to be involved in CS and vice versa. In addition, a higher connectivity, evolutionary conservation among vertebrates and essentiality may increase the probability for CS genes to be found as being involved in ARD(s).

Another interesting finding is the similarity between the patterns of evolutionary conservation of CS and cancer genes, which suggests the co-evolution of these two phenomena and calls for a wide comparative study. Of special interest would be the investigation of CS in species with exceptional longevity and resistance to tumors, such as bowhead whales. The comparative studies could shed more light on the links between cancer and CS, and may help in understanding why cancer genes stand at the crossroad of CS and ARDs.

An important point for future investigations is examining the role of CS in the formation of an aging microenvironment and its impact on the pathogenesis of ARDs. In turn, the CS phenotype could be modulated by microenvironment. As demonstrated by Choi et al. [74], the interaction of senescent cells with ECM from young cells is sufficient to restore their replicative potential and youthful morphotype. Our present and previous [23] in silico analyses together with experimental data [55] indicate that a special emphasis should be put on focal adhesion and its interactions with growth-promoting pathways.

The principal questions remain as to when it is worthwhile to induce and when to inhibit CS. What strategy is preferable, anti-or pro-CS? These questions stem, in particular, from the suggested antagonistic nature of CS in cancer [6,75]. The same dual role of CS could also be true for other ARDs but yet has to be established. Whatever the case, it seems quite plausible that the links between CS and ARDs may vary at different stages of disease and life. Induction of CS was proposed as a potential anti-cancer therapy [76,77]. Alternatively, the recent study of Baker et al. [10] showed that the drug-induced clearance of senescent cells from an early age delayed the onset of several agerelated conditions such as sarcopenia, cataracts and loss of adipose tissue in progeroid mice, and these beneficial effects were also pronounced when the elimination of the senescent cells was initiated in the adults. As a feasible tool for enhancing the clearance of senescent cells, Krizhanovsky et al. [78] suggested immunostimulatory therapy. To some extent, in favor of the anti-CS strategy are the results of our preliminary analysis hinting that the pro-longevity genes are rather anti-CS while the pro-CS genes dominate among the anti-longevity genes (unpublished data). Given the potential benefits of the anti-CS approach, an intriguing www.impactaging.com possibility could be based on iPS technology. Using this technology, Lapasset et al.

[79] demonstrated that senescent cells and the cells derived from centenarians could be reprogrammed and eventually rejuvenated. As a perspective for an in vivo application of this method, "a possible scenario may be that after several rounds of iP, the microenvironment itself would also assume a younger phenotype" [80]. Future studies of the different aspects of the links between CS and ARDs will help in selecting the most adequate therapeutic strategy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

A list of genes that have been established as being involved in CS was compiled from scientific literature and manually curated. The selection of genes was based on two lines of evidence: 1) genetic or RNA interference (RNAi) interventions (gene knockout, partial or full loss-of-function mutations, RNAi-induced gene silencing, overexpression) which reportedly cause cells to either induce, inhibit or reverse CS, and 2) genes shown to be markers of CS. The lists of LAGs and the genes involved in ARDs and aging-associated processes (oxidative stress and chronic inflammation) were obtained from databases and scientific literature as described in detail elsewhere [23,24,81]. The list of differentially expressed miRNAs in CS and of those which have been shown to affect CS was gathered and manually curated from the scientific literature [82][83][84][85][86]. Annotations regarding the involvement of miRNAs in different ARDs were taken from the Human MicroRNA Disease Database ( [87], http://cmbi.bjmu.cn/hmdd). Oncogene/Tumor Suppressor classification of cancerassociated miRNAs was done according to Wang et al. [38]. Experimentally validated targets of miRNAs have been obtained from the TarBase database ( [88], http://diana.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/tarbase/) and updated by data mining from the scientific literature.
